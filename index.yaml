    Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth 
    on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and 
    dedicated to the proposition that _all men_ are created equal.

    Now we are **TEST TEST TEST** engaged in a great civil war, testing whether 
    that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, 
    can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that 
    war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a 
    final resting place for those who here gave their lives that 
    that nation might live.

    It is **altogether fitting** and proper that we should do this.
